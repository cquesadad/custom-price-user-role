Adds custom price fields based on user role in Woocommerce Stores and allows updating the prices through WooCommerce REST API.

== Prerequisites ==

WordPress 6.5 or greater and WooCommerce 8.0.0 or greater should be installed prior to the Custom Price By User Role plugin.

Additionally you will need to install an user role plugin manager if you want to add custom roles, otherwise you will have only default wordpress user role like: subscriber, administrator, store manager and so on. 

In order to add custom role, I recommend to add Members plugin, a light weight plugin to manage Wordpress/Woocommerce user roles.

== Dewcription == 

Custom Price By User Role is an open source plugin for adding custome price by user and edit it via Woocommerce API.

This plugins has a few settings to give admin users controls over the way custom prices are showed. 

- Show/Hide custom price

This options allows admins to decide if show the custom price. Could be used for testing or for a fast desable without losing the custom price already inserted in products.
